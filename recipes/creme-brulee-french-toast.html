      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  
        <ul>
          <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
          <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons corn syrup</li>
          <li>6 (1-inch thick) slices French bread</li>
          <li>5 eggs</li> 
          <li>1 ½ cups half-and-half cream</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon brandy-based orange liqueur (such as Grand Marnier®)</li>
          <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
  
      <h3>Steps</h3>
  
        <ol>
          <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Mix in brown sugar and corn syrup, stirring until sugar is dissolved. Pour into a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
          
          <li>Remove crusts from bread, and arrange in the baking dish in a single layer. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, half and half, vanilla extract, orange brandy, and salt. Pour over the bread. Cover, and chill at least 8 hours, or overnight.</li>
          
          <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove the dish from the refrigerator, and bring to room temperature.</li>
          
          <li>Bake uncovered 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until puffed and lightly browned.</li>
